# **Flexible Piezoelectric Nanogenerator as a Self-charging Electronic Skin**  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a **Flexible Piezoelectric Nanogenerator (FPNG)** capable of harvesting mechanical energy to generate electricity. The nanogenerator uses **PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride)**, enhanced with **Bismuth Ferrite (BiFe₂O₃)** and **Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)**, to create a self-sustaining, flexible, and lightweight energy solution.  

The generator demonstrates the ability to produce up to **40 volts** under mechanical compression, making it ideal for **wearable electronics**, **biomedical devices**, and **energy harvesting systems**.

## **Materials and Methods**  

### **Key Materials**  
1. **PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride)**: Acts as the piezoelectric polymer.  
2. **N,N-Dimethylformamide**: A solvent to dissolve PVDF and promote Beta-phase formation.  
3. **Bismuth Ferrite (BiFe₂O₃)**: A ceramic oxide to enhance the piezoelectric properties.  
4. **Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)**: Incorporated to stabilize the Beta-phase and improve electrical conductivity.  

### **Working Principle**  
The nanogenerator works by utilizing the piezoelectric properties of PVDF:
- Mechanical compression alters the dipole lengths in the PVDF polymer.  
- This change in dipoles generates a measurable voltage (up to **40 volts**) through mechanical movement.

## **Fabrication Process**  
### **Step 1: Material Preparation**  
- Dissolve PVDF in **N,N-Dimethylformamide** to form a uniform polymer solution.  
- Add **BiFe₂O₃** and **Carbon Nanotubes** to enhance the Beta-phase formation.  

### **Step 2: Film Formation**  
- Cast the prepared solution onto a substrate to form thin, flexible films.  
- Allow the films to cure under controlled conditions for optimal flexibility and efficiency.  

### **Step 3: Device Assembly**  
- Integrate the piezoelectric films with electrodes and a supporting structure to create the nanogenerator.  
- Test the device for mechanical stability and electrical output.
